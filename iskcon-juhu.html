                    <p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement,
                        includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred affilated vegetarian
                        restaurants, thousands of <em>namahattas </em>or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and
                        millions of congregational members worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has
                        expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in
                        1966.</p>
                      <p>ISKCON belongs to the <em>Gaudiya-Vaishnava</em> <em>sampradāya,</em> a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic
                        or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em><em>and the Bhagavat
                          Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. </em><em>These are the historic </em>texts of the devotional <em>bhakti
                          yoga</em> tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for
                        God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.</p>
                      <p>God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant
                        God’s names in the form of the <em>maha-mantra</em>, or the great prayer for deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare
                        Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
                      <p>Members of ISKCON practice bhakti-yoga in their homes and also worship in temples. They also promote
                        bhakti-yoga, or Krishna Consciousness, through festivals, the performing arts, yoga seminars, public chanting,
                        and the distribution of the society’s literatures. ISKCON members have also opened hospitals, schools, colleges,
                        eco-villages, free food distribution projects, and other institutions as a practical application of the path of
                        devotional yoga.</p>
                      <p>Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and
                        Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “<em>a tradition that commands a respected place
                          in the religious life of humankind.</em>” In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on
                        Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, “<em>It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years
                          and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the
                          history of the Western world.</em>”</p>
                      <p>ISKCON’s founder, Srila Prabhupada, has drawn appreciation from scholars and religious leaders alike for his
                        remarkable achievement in presenting India’s Vaishnava spiritual culture in a relevant manner to contemporary
                        Western and worldwide audiences.</p>

                      <p>Hare Krishna Land (ISKCON Juhu) is set upon four acres of prime land and a stone throw away from Juhu beach.
                        A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of ISKCON, inspired the construction of one of India’s most
                        beautiful temple of Lord Krishna in Mumbai.</p>
                      <p>The presiding Deities at the temple are Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai, Sri Sri Radha Rasabihari and Sri Sri Sita Rama
                        Laxman Hanuman. The Deities were personally installed by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
                      </p>
                      <p>Today the magnificent temple complex is one of the most visited in the country. It is a spiritual oasis in the
                        dry and demanding material life of the financial and commercial capital of India.</p>
                      <p>Opened in 1978, the complex includes a spacious marble temple, a recently renovated Auditorium, a huge
                        Restaurant and a twin towered Guest Ashram, Center for Vedic Education, Library, Vedic Samskara halls, spiritual
                        boutique where visitors can stay and participate in the daily spiritual programs of the temple.</p>
